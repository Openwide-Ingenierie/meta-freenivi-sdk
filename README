meta-freenivi-sdk, the Freenivi SDK layer
=========================================

meta-freenivi-sdk is a layer containing the rules to create the SDK packages for
Qt Creator and define the two emulator machines: emulator-x86 and emulator-arm.
The outputs are Qt Installer Framework packages.
The goal of the layer is to provide an easy way to produce SDK packages for any
distribution and machines.

If you are not using the meta-freenivi layer into your bitbake build, you must
add to your local.conf the following line:
  BBMASK += "|recipes-sdk/freenivi"

Provided Machines
-----------------

The list of provided machines is:
* emulator-x86
* emulator-arm


Build a Freenivi SDK packages
-----------------------------

You can build Freenivi SDK packages using the following steps:

1. Run the following command:
    $ source <path to meta-oe>/oe-init-build-env

2. Build packages
    $ bitbake freenivi-sdk
    $ bitbake freenivi-emulator
    $ bitbake freenivi-packaged-image

You can find the produced packages in the directory:
    tmp/deploy/installer-packages/


Use Freenivi SDK with another distribution
------------------------------------------

You just need to include the class you need, depending on what you want to
build, into your "image" recipe:
* Add "include freenivi-sdk" to create the SDK of your image
* Add "include freenivi-emulator" to create the emulator package of your image.
* Add "include packaged-image" to create an installer-packaged containing your
  image

You can see the recipes in recipes-sdk/freenivi as examples.

Note: emulator packages are only buildable with emulator-x86 or emulator-arm as
MACHINE, and their credentials are:
  user: root
  password: freenivi
